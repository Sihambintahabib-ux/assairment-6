### ANSEWER
### What is the difference between var, let, and const?
**DESCRIPTION :** var is a tradition a tradion way to declare a variable while let and const is introducer in ES6 . 
#### **VAR :** 
1. Old and risky
2. Scoped to functions, not blocks
3. Can be redeclared and reassigned
4. Hoisted to the top with undefined value
#### **let :** 
 1. Modern and safe
 2. Scoped to blocks ( {} )
3. Can be reassigned but not redeclared
4. Hoisted, but stays in the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)
#### **const :** 
1. Constant values
2. Scoped to blocks
3. Cannot be reassigned or redeclared
4. Value must be assigned at declaration
5. Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) applies here too

### What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?
#### **map() :**
- map() transforms each element and returns a new array of the same length.
#### **filter() :**
- filter() selects elements that meet a specified condition and returns a new array that may be shorter.
#### **forEach() :**
- forEach() simply iterates through each element to perform an action, and it returns undefined

---

### What are arrow functions in ES6?
#### **arrow functions :**
- Short, concise functions and "one-liners" that need an implicit return.
- No own this , no arguments object
- Cleaner syntax 
- syntax : `() => "Hello World" `

### How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?
- destructuring a new feature introduce in es6 
- a new way to access value from array(array destructuring) and object(object destructuring)

---

### Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
- provide a more powerful and flexible way to work with strings than traditional concatenation. They are enclosed by backticks (`) instead of single or double quotes.
- syntax of writing function in template literals : `${}`
