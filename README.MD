### What is the difference between var, let, and const?

### What are arrow functions in ES6?

- When an event happens on an element, it first runs the handlers on it, then on its parent, then all the way up on other ancestors.
- in simple words , instead of selecting all child , selecting parent for better output is known as **enent bubbling**

### How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?

- Event Delegation : used to manage and handle events on multiple child elements by attaching a single event listener to a common ancestor element.
### uses of Event Delegation : 
 1. Improved Performance and Reduced Memory Usage
2. Cleaner and More Maintainable Code
3. Easy accesable of the code
